* Daedalus specific instructions (changes from main spec):

We *will not* be using Gradescope for our labs. For this lab, for each
task (A through D) create the program files ~smaller.cpp~,
~smaller3.cpp~, ~leap.cpp~, and ~month.cpp~. Each should work as
specified in the main lab page. Add all four ~.cpp~ files to the
assignment repository, commit and push them.

Make sure to test each program to make sure it works correctly.
